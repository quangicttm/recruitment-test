How do we test the code?
- Using Python and the libraries can be used to solve the problem.
- Clean code.
- Documentation what the code does and how to run it (in the code)
- The result of the code should be returned in a new file (not printed in the console - can be a .csv file)

Requirements:
- Write a function that downloads the data from this URL: https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yyL20BNKv3PxJRJVjJ_2Q-HidvIUis45&export=download (file .zip) 
    and saves it in the data directory
- Extract the .zip file and read the .csv file inside data directory
- Write a function that returns the number of rows and columns of the .csv file
- Write a function to display specific columns as follows: index, customer_id, first_name, last_name, phone_1 from the file you extracted about . 
    Save the result in a new .csv file.
